# This Hero, That Villain 

This isn't something ambitious, something huge and meaningful. It's just a side-scrolling runner game, but I'm happy that I've done something playable for my first LD.

You're playing as one of few characters from game/fairy tale and you're chased by different, bad characters from some other games/fairy tales/movie.

Controls: Spacebar is jumping and menu is controlled with mouse.
